             <h2>Globally, we throw out about 1.3 billion tons of food a year, or a third of all the food that we grow.</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
                That’s important for at least two reasons. The less the world wastes, the easier it will be to meet the food needs of the global population in coming years. Second, cutting back on waste could go a long way to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
                How do we manage to waste so much?
        </p> 
        <p>
                Food waste is a glaring measure of inequality. In poor countries, most of the food waste is on the farm or on its way to market. In South Asia, for instance, half of all the cauliflower that’s grown is lost because there’s not enough refrigeration, according to Rosa Rolle, an expert on food waste and loss at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Tomatoes get squished if they are packed into big sacks. In Southeast Asia, lettuce spoils on the way from farms to city supermarkets. Very little food in poor countries is thrown out by consumers. It’s too precious.

                <h2>A global perspective on food waste.</h2>
            <p>
                From taking a global perspective, it becomes clear there is no “one size fits all” response when it comes to food waste reduction opportunities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing countries will benefit from infrastructure improvements further upstream in the supply chain to prolong freshness and quality. For developed countries, however, emphasis should be to shape consumer behavior, as well as taking other steps to ensure that consumers are delivered the freshest products, with the most shelf life possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective food waste strategies are complex. In addition to pursuing local opportunities in a particular country, a proactive approach to the entire supply chain is needed to make significant and enduring improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                One element of your strategy that can make a difference is the use of RPCs. IFCO RPCs have been proven by independent research to provide an optimal solution for preserving the quality and freshness of perishable products, and by reducing waste to landfill by 86% compared to single use packaging.
